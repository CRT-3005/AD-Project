# AD-Project

## Objective

This Project aimed to create a basic AD environment, utilise the user accounts to perform attacks on from Kali and have Splunk configured to generate telemetry from the target machines. 
In total there were 4 VMs. A VM running Windows 10 with Splunk forwarding and Sysmon configured on. A VM running Windows Server machine running AD which also had Splunk forwarding and Sysmon configured on. A VM running Ubunutu which was configured for Splunk. Finally a VM running Kali Linux.

## Skills Learned

- Ability to setup ADDS.
- How to setup a SIEM on Ubuntu server.
- Configuring Splunk/Sysmon forwarding from target machines.
- Understanding of generating and reading network logs.
- Start to understand common attacker trends.

## Tools Used

- ViurtalBox for setting up VM enviroment and creating a NAT network.
